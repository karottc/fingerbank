fingerbank
==========

No! Fingerbank is not an organ bank for nice fingers ;)

It is a database for device fingerprinting based on different properties (DHCP fingerprints, 
DHCP vendors, OUI, user-agents, ...) allowing your applications to fully detect then handle 
a custom workflow based on the device type.

upstream
--------
Codebase of the master Fingerbank database / interface.

remote
------
Codebase of the application / webservice that runs locally in conjunction with your application and handling local 
Fingerbank database / interface syncing with the upstream.
